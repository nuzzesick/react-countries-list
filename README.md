Small application to fetch countries and see their details (https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2), has a switch button where you can toggle between dark and light mode.
I created this project in order to test some cool libraries and hooks that I found interesting such as useContext, styled-components, useLocalStorage, etc.


To run this project: yarn i => yarn start.
